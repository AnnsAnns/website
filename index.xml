In the typical developer fashion I wrote a single blog post and then abandoned the whole site for nearly a year. In that time I mostly mastered Golang and did a lot of other things that I really want to talk about sooner or later. For now I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to write about my journey with microcontrollers in smaller more common blog posts instead.</description></item><item><title>Coming from Python to Go</title><link>https://tomger.eu/posts/golang-adventure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomger.eu/posts/golang-adventure/</guid><description>In this little mini-series of blog posts I&amp;rsquo;m going to showcase the problems I faced learning Go and the cool tricks and tips I accumulated while trying to solve them. In this first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a small introduction into the world of Go from a Python developers perspective, which means that some general knowledge about Python programming is required here.
The next blog posts are going to be purely focused on problems inside of Go and are thus for people that are already familiar with Go.</description></item></channel></rss>
