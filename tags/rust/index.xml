At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to use the language to a great extend but the more I use it, the more I like it. Besides the great compiler and all the other benefits Rust comes with, the tooling is also amazing. There are so many useful community and first-party tools for many boilerplate problems that keep you from working efficiently, from easy wasm support to embedded software.</description></item><item><title>Rust, Risc-V and embedded systems</title><link>https://tomger.eu/posts/rust-microcontrollers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomger.eu/posts/rust-microcontrollers/</guid><description>Guess what, I still exist. In the typical developer fashion I wrote a single blog post and then abandoned the whole site for nearly a year. In that time I mostly mastered Golang and did a lot of other things that I really want to talk about sooner or later. For now I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to write about my journey with microcontrollers in smaller more common blog posts instead.</description></item></channel></rss>
