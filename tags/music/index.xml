Being a perfect game developer is comparable to being the avatar. You need to master (at least) the elements of programming, art, game design and music. Only when a game manages to have a perfect balance of these elements most people will actually enjoy it, otherwise your product will often suffer from a noticeable lack.
The participation in game jams is often one of the best indicators for this inequality in the indie scene.</description></item></channel></rss>
