In this first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a small introduction into the world of Go from a Python developers perspective, which means that some general knowledge about Python programming is required here.
The next blog posts are going to be purely focused on problems inside of Go and are thus for people that are already familiar with Go.</description></item></channel></rss>
